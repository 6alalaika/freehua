## Purpose 

FreeHua is a platform designed for the publication and reading of Sino-Korean comics, commonly known as manhwas (South Korean) and manhuas (Chinese). This application offers the convenience of offline reading, enhancing accessibility for users. Additionally, it features a comprehensive filtering system, making it easier for readers to discover specific genres and works.

One of FreeHua's key objectives is to broaden the appreciation of Korean and Chinese cultures in Brazil, where the current market doesn't fully meet the growing demand from Brazilian fans. To achieve this, all comics on the app will be available in Brazilian Portuguese. This is made possible through a website where scanlation communities (amateur translation groups) can publish their translations on the FreeHua platform.

The app aims to make the reading of Sino-Korean comics more accessible, swift, and user-friendly, fostering a seamless interaction between users and the rich South Asian culture.
